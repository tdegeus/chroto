Notes for developers
********************

To start understanding the code one is advised to start from two sides:

1.  Study the structure and comments in ``mainwindow.h``.

2.  Study the structure and names in ``mainwindow.ui`` using Qt Creator. In Qt Creator a large portion of the function behind the buttons (the slots) can be studied.
